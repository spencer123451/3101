Good Growth,"As a result, you may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign
judgments or bringing actions in China against us or our management based on foreign laws.”
We face various risks and uncertainties related to doing business in China."
Good Growth,"These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about:
●

our mission, vision, strengths and growth strategies;

●

our future business development, results of operations and financial condition;

relevant government policies and regulations relating to our business and industry;

foreign judgments or bringing actions in China against us or our management based on foreign laws."
Bad Growth,"In such events, our Ordinary Shares and ADSs could decline in value or become worthless."
Bad Growth,"●

The trading price of the ADSs has been and may continue to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors."
Bad Growth,"Any such action, once taken by the PRC government, could cause the value of our securities to significantly
decline or become worthless."
Good Growth,"11

Moreover, an unfavorable outcome in any of these matters could result in significant damages, additional penalties or other remedies imposed
against us, and/or our current or former directors or officers, which could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows."
Bad Growth,"Entering into the settlement
with the SEC also results in the loss of certain exemptions or protections that were available to us under federal securities laws."
Good Growth,"These proceedings, investigations and inquiries may result in damages, fines, penalties, consent orders or other
administrative sanctions against us and/or certain of our officers, or in changes to our business practices, among others."
Good Growth,"Moreover, the matters that led to our Internal Investigation and our financial restatement for the second and third quarters in 2019
have exposed us to increased risks of regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions."
Good Growth,"We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed by purchasers of our securities, including class action lawsuits and will,

ADS and have made informal demands for the Company to pay alleged losses resulting from the Fabricated Transactions disclosed on April 2,
2020."

Good Growth,The Fabricated Transactions have exposed us to increased risks of litigation.

against us, our current or former directors or officers, which could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash

Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry
Our limited operating history may not be indicative of our future growth or financial results and we may not be able to sustain our historical
growth rates."
Good Growth,We commenced our operations in October 2017 and have achieved significant growth since our inception.
Good Growth,"Our limited operating history may not be indicative of our future growth
or financial results."
Good Growth,There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical growth rates in future periods.
Good Growth,"Our growth rates may
decline for any number of possible reasons and some of them are beyond our control, including decreasing customer spending, increasing
competition, declining growth of China’s coffee industry or China’s food and beverage sector in general, emergence of alternative business models,
or changes in government policies or general economic conditions."
Good Growth,"We will continue to expand our product offerings and may explore new
operating models to bring greater convenience to our customers and to increase our customer base and the number of transactions."
Good Growth,"If our growth rates decline, investors’ perceptions of our business and prospects
may be adversely affected and the trading price of the ADSs could decline."
Good Growth,"In addition, since our business model is innovative in China’s coffee
industry, it may increase the difficulty in evaluating our business and future prospects based on our historical operational or financial results."
Good Growth,"The major challenges in
managing our business growth include, among other things:
●

effectively identifying and securing locations for new stores and managing the daily operations of our stores."
Good Growth,"16

Table of Contents

All efforts to address the challenges of our growth require significant managerial, financial and human resources."
Good Growth,"We cannot assure you that
we will be able to execute managerial, operating and financial strategies to keep up with our growth."
Good Growth,"If we cannot manage our growth or execute
our strategies effectively, our growth may slow down and our business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected."
Good Growth,"Our ability to cost-effectively attract new customers and retain existing customers is crucial to driving net revenues growth and achieving
profitability."
Bad Growth,"In addition, if we reduce or discontinue our current discount offers and deals,
if our existing customers no longer find our products appealing, or if our competitors offer more attractive products, prices, discounts or better
customer services, our existing customers may lose interest in us, decrease their orders or even stop ordering from us."
Bad Growth,"If we are unable to retain our
existing customers or to acquire new customers in a cost-effective manner, our revenues may decrease and our results of operations will be
adversely affected."
Good Growth,"●

The operating results of our stores have been and will continue to be subject to a number of factors, including but not limited to:

●

our ability to maintain and enhance the quality of our products and services or to develop and launch new products that meet our
customers’ needs;

●

our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers;

●

our ability to continually increase the number of items sold to each customer and number of items sold in each store;

●

our ability to successfully implement our pricing strategies;

●

our ability to timely respond to changes in market opportunities and customer preferences;

●

our ability to maintain good relationships with third-party suppliers, service providers and strategic partners;

●

our ability to hire, train and retain talented employees;

●

our ability to manage costs of our operations, such as cost of materials, store rental, labor and other operating costs, and sales and
marketing expenses;

●

our ability to ensure full compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and maintain adequate and effective control, supervision and risk
management over our stores; and

●

our ability to monitor and control the overall operation of our stores."
Good Growth,"Additionally, the growth of China’s coffee industry is affected by customer tastes, preferences, perceptions and spending patterns."
Good Growth,"Since we
have generated, and expect to continue to generate, a considerable amount of our revenues from the sale of coffee, a shift in customer preferences
away from coffee, the changes of spending pattern adversely affecting consumption of coffee, or the decrease or slow growth of coffee
consumption in China would harm our business, more than if our revenues were generated from more diversified products."
Bad Growth,"The retail partnership model may subject us to a number of risks, including but not limited to:
●

We might not be able to effectively control retail partners’ actions and their daily store operation, and in case that their actions harm our
business, our contractual rights and remedies are limited;

●

The unsatisfactory service provided by or misconduct of our retail partners may harm the goodwill associated with our brands, and may
adversely impact our business and results of operations;

●

The revenues we realize from partnership stores are partly dependent on our retail partners’ ability to grow their sales;

●

The failure of our retail partners to comply with local regulatory rules may subject us to losses and harm our reputation;

●

Retail partners may not completely fulfill their obligation under the partnership agreement, which may adversely impact our business and
results of operations;

●

The number and quality of retail partners are subject to change over time, which may negatively affect our business; and

●

Our retail partners may be subject to a variety of litigation risks, including, but not limited to, customer claims, food safety claims and
employee allegations of improper termination."
Good Growth,"Although we are not directly liable for the costs involved in these types of litigation, each
of these claims may increase the costs of our retail partners and adversely affect their profitability, which in turn could adversely affect
our business, operating results and brand."
Good Growth,"Some competitors are well established in China
and any defensive measures they take in response to our expansion could hinder our growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations."
Good Growth,"Business Overview—Competition.” Increased competition
may reduce our market share and profitability and require us to increase our sales and marketing efforts and capital commitment in the future,
which could negatively affect our results of operations or force us to incur further losses."
Good Growth,"Although we have accumulated a large and growing
customer base, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future against current or future competitors, and such
competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations."
Bad Growth,"We have incurred significant operating losses attributable to the Company and we may continue to experience significant operating losses in
the future."
Bad Growth,We have incurred significant operating losses attributable to the Company since our inception in June 2017.
Bad Growth,"For the year ended December 31,
2021, we incurred operating losses of RMB539.1 million, primarily attributable to the expenses in relation to the startup and fast expansion of our
business."
Good Growth,"Therefore, our revenues may not grow at the rate we expect and may not increase sufficiently to offset the increase in our expenses."
Bad Growth,"We may
continue to incur losses in the future and we cannot assure you that we will eventually achieve profitability."
Good Growth,"If we cannot obtain sufficient capital on acceptable
terms to meet our capital needs, we may not be able to execute our growth strategies, and our business, financial condition and prospects may be
materially and adversely affected."
Good Growth,"If we lose the services of any member of key management or our experienced and capable personnel, we may not be able to locate
suitable or qualified replacements, and may incur additional expenses to recruit and train new staff, which could severely disrupt our business and
growth."
Good Growth,"Our rapid growth also requires us to hire, train, and retain a wide range of personnel who can adapt to a dynamic, competitive and challenging
business environment and are capable of helping us conduct effective marketing, innovate new products, and develop technological capabilities."
Good Growth,"Any failure to attract, train, retain or motivate key management and experienced and capable
personnel could severely disrupt our business and growth."
Bad Growth,"Any such disruptions may result in loss of potential orders, failures to deliver the
customer order on time, or at all, and negative impact on the results of our business operations, financial performance and reputation."
Good Growth,"Business Overview—Food Safety
and Quality Control.” However, due to the scale of our operations and growth of our store network, maintaining consistent product quality depends
significantly on the effectiveness of our quality control system, which in turn depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to the
design of our quality control system, employee training to ensure that our employees adhere to and implement our quality control policies and
procedures and the effectiveness of monitoring any potential violation of our quality control policies and procedures."
Bad Growth,"In addition, we may be unable to receive sufficient compensation from suppliers and service providers for the losses caused
by them.”
If customers become ill from food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination, mislabeling or other food or beverage
safety issues, we could be forced to temporarily close the impacted stores and/or be involved in related disputes or legal proceedings."
Bad Growth,"A
decrease in customer confidence in the safety and quality of our products or any food safety issues could materially harm our business and results
of operations."
Bad Growth,"Therefore,
our technology infrastructure, including our mobile apps, may not function properly if we fail to detect or solve technical errors in a
timely manner; and

●

our systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption as a result of earthquakes, floods, fires, extreme temperatures, power
loss, telecommunications failures, technical error, computer viruses, hacking and similar events."
Bad Growth,"These and other events may lead to the unavailability of our mobile apps, interruption of our supply chain and delivery, interruption of
unmanned machines, leakage or permanent loss of customer data, interruptions or decreases in connection speed, or other events which would
negatively affect our operations."
Bad Growth,"We recorded impairment loss of long-lived assets of RMB52.1 million and RMB2.1 million in 2019
and 2020, respectively, in connection with the first generation Luckin Coffee EXPRESS machines that we purchased or prepaid for trial operation
in 2019 and the subsequent launch in 2020."
Good Growth,"Growth of our business will partially depend on the recognition of our brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand
would limit our ability to grow or retain our customer base, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations."
Good Growth,"We believe that recognition of our brand among customers has helped us manage our customer acquisition costs and contributed to the growth
and success of our business."
Good Growth,"These factors
include but are not limited to our ability to:
●

maintain the quality and attractiveness of the products we offer;

●

develop and launch new products that satisfy our customers’ needs;

●

provide a superior customer experience;

●

increase brand awareness through marketing and brand promotion activities;

●

maintain good relationships and retain favorable terms with our suppliers, service providers and other business partners;

●

stay compliant with relevant laws and regulations;

●

compete effectively against existing and future competitors; and

●

preserve our reputation and goodwill generally and in the event of any negative publicity on our products, services and data security, or
other issues affecting us, China’s coffee industry or China’s food and beverage sector in general."
Good Growth,"We also regularly offer coupons and vouchers to increase our customer base,
retain our existing customers or promote new products, and such promotion activities might not be sustainable."
Good Growth,"Any factors listed above, either individually or in aggregate, might delay or fail our plan to increase the number of stores in desirable locations
at manageable cost levels."
Good Growth,"If we or our retail partners fail to obtain the necessary licenses, permits and approvals, we may be
subject to fines, confiscation of the gains derived from the related stores or the suspension of operations of the related stores."
Good Growth,"Despite the improvement of our operating cash position in 2021, 2022 and 2023, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain that
positive operating cash position in the future."
Good Growth,"If our cost of continuing operations increases in the future or our cash generated from operating
activities does not meet our expectation, our operating cash position could worsen, and our business could be adversely affected because of the
limited amount of cash available to meet the cash needs for operating our business and to fund our investments in our business expansion."
Bad Growth,"In addition, we may be
unable to receive sufficient compensation from suppliers and service providers for the losses caused by them."
Good Growth,"For example, the failure of our raw material suppliers to ensure product quality or to comply with food safety
or other laws and regulations could interrupt our operations and result in claims against us, and any delay in delivery of our products, damage to
our products during the course of delivery and inappropriate actions taken by delivery riders of our delivery service providers might cause customer
complaints."
Bad Growth,"For example, we may not be able to fully cover compensation from our retail partners in case that our losses attributed to their actions exceed their
deposit withheld by us."
Good Growth,"If no claim can be asserted against a supplier, our retail partners, or service provider, or amounts that we claim cannot be
fully recovered from the supplier, our retail partners, or service provider, we may be required to bear such losses and compensation at our own
costs."
Good Growth,"If the cost of raw materials and pre-made products increases after expiration of existing agreements, due to large
market price fluctuation or due to any other reason, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected."
Good Growth,"Uncertainties relating to the growth of China’s coffee industry and food and beverage industry could adversely affect our revenues and
business prospects."
Bad Growth,"A decline in the popularity of coffee, especially freshly brewed coffee, or any failure by us to adapt our strategies in response to trends in
China’s coffee industry and food and beverage industry in general may adversely affect our results of operations and business prospects."
Good Growth,"For example, a
number of research studies conclude or suggest that excessive consumption of caffeine may lead to increased heart rate, nausea and vomiting,
restlessness and anxiety, depression, headaches, tremors, sleeplessness and other adverse health effects."
Good Growth,"Our operations in international markets will expose us to various risks,
including but not limited to those arising from:
●

competition with local competitors (which may have greater resources and/or more favorable market positions);
26

Table of Contents

●

the diversity of customer preferences and demand and our ability to anticipate or respond to such preferences and demand;

●

changes in the political and economic environments in the countries where we operate;

●

changes in laws and regulations, including tax regulations, and the imposition of new duties or other protectionist measures;

●

regulatory or customary restrictions to any aspect of our existing business model;

●

difficulties and costs associated with complying with, and enforcing remedies under, a wide variety of complex domestic and
international laws, treaties and regulations;

●

economic sanctions, trade restrictions, discrimination, protectionism or unfavorable policies against China-based companies;

●

the infringement of our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions;

●

exposure to litigation or third-party claims outside the PRC;

●

foreign currency exchange controls and fluctuations; and

●

the occurrence of acts of terrorism or similar events, conflicts, civil unrest or situations of political instability, uncertainties in
international relations or geopolitical tensions."
Good Growth,"Overall tightening of the labor market, increases in labor costs or any possible labor unrest may adversely affect our business and results of
operations."
Good Growth,"We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increases in labor costs due to increases in
salary, social benefits and employee headcount."
Good Growth,"In particular, we face a number of challenges relating to data from transactions and
other activities on our system, including:
●

protecting the data in and hosted on our system, including against attacks on our system by third parties or fraudulent behavior by our
employees;

●

addressing concerns related to privacy and sharing, safety, security and other factors; and

●

complying with applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal information,
including any requests from regulatory and government authorities relating to such data."
Good Growth,"Any failure, or perceived failure, by us, our employees, our business partners, or their employees to comply with privacy policies
or with any regulatory requirements or privacy protection-related laws, rules and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by
governmental entities or others."
Good Growth,"These proceedings or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change
our business practices, increase our costs and severely disrupt our business."
Good Growth,"Recently, companies’ practices regarding collection, use, retention, transfer, disclosure and security of user data have been the subject of
enhanced regulations and increased public scrutiny."
Good Growth,"The PRC
government is increasingly focused on data security, and has launched cybersecurity review against a number of mobile apps operated by several
U.S.-listed Chinese companies and prohibited these apps from registering new users during the review period."
Good Growth,"Compliance with these laws and requirements in manners that are perceived as harming privacy could lead to significant
damage to our reputation and proceedings and actions against us by regulators and private parties."
Bad Growth,"According to the CII Protection Regulations, critical information infrastructure, or
the CII, refers to any important network facilities or information systems of the important industry or field such as public communication and
information service, energy, transportation, water conservancy, finance, public services, e-government affairs and national defense science, which
may endanger national security, people’s livelihood and public interest in the case of damage, function loss or data leakage."
Good Growth,"The Provisions on
Cross-border Data Transfer clarify the circumstances where compliance requirements (such as data outbound transfer security assessment, the
execution of personal information outbound transfer standard contract or personal information protection certification) are waived, and the
circumstances where such compliance requirements shall be performed, in response to the confusion of various enterprises in practice."
Good Growth,"Any
change in laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security and any enhanced governmental enforcement action of
such laws and regulations could greatly increase our cost in providing our products and services, limit their use or adoption or require certain
changes to be made to our operations."
Good Growth,"We expect that these areas
will receive greater and continued attention and scrutiny from regulators and the public going forward, which could increase our compliance costs
and subject us to heightened risks and challenges associated with data security and protection."
Good Growth,"Any failure to comply with applicable regulations,
whether by us, business partners, or other third parties, or as a result of employee error or negligence or otherwise, could result in regulatory
enforcement actions, including fines, suspension of business, prohibition against new user registration (even for a short period of time) and
revocation of required licenses, against us and have an adverse impact on our business operations and our reputation."
Good Growth,"Security breaches and attacks against our technology systems, and any potentially resulting breach or failure to otherwise protect confidential
and proprietary information, could damage our reputation and negatively impact our business, as well as materially and adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations."
Good Growth,"Although we have employed significant resources to develop our security measures against breaches, our cybersecurity measures may not
detect or prevent all attempts to compromise our systems, including distributed denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins,
phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information
stored in and transmitted by our systems or that we otherwise maintain."
Good Growth,"As techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be
known until launched against us or our third-party service providers, we may be unable to anticipate, or implement adequate measures to protect
against, these attacks."
Good Growth,"We have in the past and are likely again in the future to be subject to these types of attacks, although as of the date of this annual report no such
attack has resulted in any material damages or remediation costs."
Good Growth,"We pay these payment
providers varying service fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs."
Good Growth,"Rent for our leases is typically
fixed amounts and subject to annual or biennially incremental increases as stipulated in the lease agreements, or fixed amounts plus a variable rent
rate linked to the store performance."
Good Growth,"We cannot assure you that we would be able to renew the relevant lease agreements without substantial
additional cost or increase in the rental cost payable by us."
Bad Growth,"If we are unable to renew the leases for our store sites, we will have to close or relocate the store, which could subject us to decoration and
other costs and risks, and loss of existing customers, and could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations."
Good Growth,"Although failure to
do so does not in itself invalidate the leases, the lessees may not be able to defend these leases against bona fide third parties and may also be
exposed to potential fines if they fail to rectify such noncompliance within the prescribed time frame after receiving notice from the relevant PRC
government authorities."
Bad Growth,"In the event that any fine is imposed on us for our failure to register our lease
agreements, we may not be able to recover such losses from the lessors."
Good Growth,"Any complaints or claims against us, even if meritless and unsuccessful, may divert management attention and other resources from our
business and adversely affect our business and operations."
Good Growth,"For
example, in November 2020, UCAR Inc. approached us seeking payment for certain historical expenses UCAR Inc. allegedly paid on behalf of us,
including but not limited to the costs incurred for leasehold improvements of certain office space that we occupied."
Good Growth,"In September 2021, UCAR Inc.
initiated an arbitration proceeding against Luckin Group in China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission, seeking to recover its
costs and other relevant expenses allegedly incurred of approximately RMB38.4 million."
Good Growth,"As of December 31, 2022, the arbitration proceeding was
closed with the final judgment that we were obligated to pay approximately RMB 31.7 million for the leasehold improvement and related legal
fees."
Good Growth,"We, our directors, management and employees may be subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings, such as claims in
relation to commercial, food safety, labor, employment, privacy, information security, antitrust, securities matters or any other subject, and may
not always be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings."
Good Growth,"For example, customers could assert legal claims
against us in connection with personal injuries related to food poisoning or tampering."
Bad Growth,"Sellers are responsible for compensation on customer’s loss even if the contamination of food is not caused by the
sellers."
Bad Growth,"Unless otherwise indicated, we cannot reasonably
predict the outcome of these legal proceedings, nor can we estimate the amount of loss, or range of loss, if any, that may result from these
proceedings."
Bad Growth,"An adverse outcome in certain of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations, and could cause the market value of our ADSs and/or other securities to decline."
Good Growth,"In addition, there can be no assurance that our insurance carriers will cover all or part of the defense costs, or
any liabilities that may arise from these matters."
Good Growth,"Allegations against us or our management may harm our reputation and have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of
operations and cash flows."
Good Growth,"For example, on January 3, 2021, our Board received a letter from certain employees containing allegations
against our Chairman and CEO, Dr. Jinyi Guo."
Good Growth,"Allegations
against us or our management may also generate negative publicity that significantly harms our reputation, which may materially and adversely
affect our user base and our ability to attract customers."
Good Growth,"Holders of
intellectual property purportedly relating to some aspects of our technology platform or business have sought and may continue to seek to enforce
such intellectual property against us in China, the United States or any other jurisdictions."
Good Growth,"To defend against these infringement claims, regardless
of their merits, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses, and we have been and may continue to be forced to divert our
management’s time and other resources from our business and operations."
Good Growth,"There have been instances where third parties registered social media accounts under names similar
to our trademarks in order to gain illegal benefits, against which we have initiated legal proceedings, and we may continue to become an attractive
target to such attacks in the future with the increasing recognition of our brand."
Good Growth,"As China’s coffee industry as well as China’s food and beverage market in general is
evolving rapidly and the PRC government is very concerned about customer protection, new laws and regulations may be adopted to address new
issues that arise from time to time and to impose additional restrictions on our current business."
Good Growth,"As we continue to grow in scale and significance, we expect to face increased scrutiny, which will, at a minimum, result in our having to
increase our investment in compliance and related capabilities and systems."
Good Growth,"The increasing sophistication and development of our customer base
will also increase the need for higher standards of customer protection, privacy protection and dispute management."
Good Growth,"Any increased involvement in
inquiries or investigations could result in significantly higher legal and other costs and diversion of management and other resources, as well as
negative publicity, which could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations."
Good Growth,"We cannot assure you that
the digital infrastructure and the telecommunications networks in China will be able to support the demands associated with the continued growth
in digital usage."
Good Growth,"If the prices we pay for
telecommunications and digital services rise significantly, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected."
Good Growth,"Furthermore, if data
access fees or other charges to mobile users increase, our user traffic may decline and our business may be harmed."
Bad Growth,"If we fail to manage our inventory effectively, we may be subject to a heightened risk of inventory
obsolescence, a decline in inventory value, and significant inventory write-downs or write-offs."
Good Growth,"Exercise of the share-based awards granted will increase the number of our shares in circulation, which may adversely
affect the market price of our shares."
Good Growth,"We adopted a share incentive plan in January 2019 (the “2019 Share Option Plan”) to enhance our ability to attract and retain exceptionally
qualified individuals and to encourage them to acquire a proprietary interest in our growth and performance."
Good Growth,"As a result, our expenses associated with share-based compensation may
increase, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations."
Bad Growth,"Climate related events have the potential to disrupt our business, including the business of our suppliers, and may cause us to experience higher
attrition, losses and additional costs to resume operations."
Good Growth,The growth and profitability of our business depend on the level of customer demand and discretionary spending in China.
Bad Growth,"A severe or
prolonged downturn in China’s economy could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations."
Bad Growth,"Any deterioration of the
PRC economy, decrease in disposable customer income and fear of a recession may lead to a reduction of customer demand and average spending
per customer at our stores, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations."
Good Growth,"New accounting guidance may require systems
and other changes that could increase our operating costs and/or change our financial statements."
Bad Growth,"As a result, we may not be able to acquire insurance for all the potential
risks we face in our operations in China, and our coverage may not be adequate to compensate for all losses that may occur, particularly with
respect to loss of business or operations."
Bad Growth,"There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage is sufficient to prevent us from any loss or that we will be able to successfully claim our
losses under our current insurance policy on a timely basis, or at all."
Bad Growth,"If we incur any loss that is not covered by our insurance policies, or the
compensated amount is significantly less than our actual loss, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and
adversely affected."
Good Growth,"As a result, you may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign
judgments or bringing actions in China against us or our management based on foreign laws."
Bad Growth,"We could face material
and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that the historical VIE contractual arrangements were not entered into on an
arm’s-length basis in such a way as to result in an impermissible reduction in taxes under applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations, and adjust the
income of the Former VIE, if any, in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment."
Good Growth,"A transfer pricing adjustment could, among other things, result in a
reduction of expense deductions recorded by the Former VIE for PRC tax purposes, which could in turn increase its tax liabilities without reducing
our PRC subsidiaries’ tax expenses."
Good Growth,"Our financial position could be adversely affected if the Former VIE’s tax
liabilities increase or if it is required to pay late payment fees and other penalties."
Good Growth,"The rights of shareholders to take action against our directors, actions by our minority shareholders and the
fiduciary duties of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands."
Good Growth,"Moreover, certain judgments obtained against us by our shareholders may not be enforceable."
Good Growth,"As a result, it may be
difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the United States in the event that you believe that your
rights have been infringed under the U.S. federal securities laws or otherwise."
Good Growth,"Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws
of the Cayman Islands and of China may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers."
Good Growth,"Share Ownership.” Centurium Capital’s voting power gives it the power to control certain actions that require shareholder approval under
Cayman Islands law and our memorandum and articles of association, including authorization of a plan of merger, changes to our memorandum
and articles of association and an increase of our authorized share capital."
Bad Growth,"In such events, our Ordinary Shares and ADSs could decline in value or become worthless."
Good Growth,"The Chinese economy differs
from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement, level of development, growth
rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources."
Good Growth,"Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the
utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved
corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government."
Good Growth,"The Chinese
government also exercises significant control over China’s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies."
Bad Growth,"Any such action could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer
securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless."
Good Growth,"While the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and across
various sectors of the economy."
Good Growth,"Any adverse changes in economic conditions in China, in the policies of the Chinese government or in the laws and
regulations in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China."
Bad Growth,"Such developments could adversely affect our
business and operating results, lead to a reduction in demand for our products and adversely affect our competitive position."
Good Growth,"The Chinese
government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources."
Good Growth,"In addition, in the past the Chinese government
has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustment, to control the pace of economic growth."
Bad Growth,"These measures may cause
decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our business and operating results."
Bad Growth,"Any such action, once taken by the PRC government, could cause the value of our securities to significantly
decline or become worthless."
Good Growth,"Before January 1, 2020, each of our PRC subsidiaries as a
Foreign Invested Enterprise (the “FIE”), is also required to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund,
although the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at its discretion."
Good Growth,"In addition, the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax rate of up to 10% will be
applicable to dividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless otherwise exempted or reduced according to treaties
or arrangements between the PRC central government and governments of other countries or regions where the non-PRC resident enterprises are
incorporated."
Good Growth,"On January 5, 2023, the NDRC promulgated the Administrative Measures for the Approval and Registration of Medium and Long-term
Foreign Debts of Enterprises, or the NDRC Measures, effective on February 10, 2023."
Good Growth,"Pursuant to the NDRC Measures, if a PRC enterprise or an
offshore enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise wishes to issue bonds outside the PRC with a maturity of more than one year, such PRC
enterprise must, in advance of issuing such bonds, file certain prescribed documents with the NDRC and obtain a registration certificate from the
NDRC in respect of such issue."
Good Growth,"The enterprise
must also report certain details of the bonds to the NDRC within 10 business days upon the completion of the bond issuance."

On February 24, 2023, the Provisions on Strengthening the Confidentiality and Archives Administration of Overseas Securities Issuance and
Listing by Domestic Enterprises was promulgated, or the Provision on Confidentiality, which became effective on March 31, 2023."
Good Growth,"Pursuant to the
Provision on Confidentiality, where a domestic enterprise publicly discloses or provides documents and materials involving state secrets and
working secrets of state organs, or Relevant Documents and Materials, to the relevant securities companies, securities service institutions, overseas
regulatory authorities and other entities and individuals, or provides or publicly discloses Relevant Documents and Materials through its overseas
listing subjects, it shall report to the competent department with the examination and approval authority for approval in accordance with the law,
and submit to the secrecy administration department of the same level for filing."
Good Growth,"Where a domestic enterprise provides accounting archives or
copies of such archives to entities and individuals such as securities companies, securities service institutions and overseas regulatory authorities, it
shall complete the corresponding procedures pursuant to relevant rules of the State."
Good Growth,"The working materials formed within the territory of the PRC
by the securities companies and securities service institutions that provide corresponding services for the overseas issuance and listing of domestic
enterprises shall be kept within the territory of the PRC, and outbound transfers of such materials shall go through approval procedures in
accordance with relevant rules of the State."
Good Growth,"We may not be able to recover our losses from advertisers by enforcing the indemnification provisions in the contracts, which
may result us in diverting management’s time and other resources from our business and operations to defend against these infringement claims."
Good Growth,"The amended PRC Anti-monopoly Law further regulates monopolistic behaviors in the Internet
sector, which provides, among others, (i) enterprises must not engage in monopolistic behaviors by taking advantage of data and algorithms,
technology, capital advantages, or platform rules; and (ii) enterprises with dominant market position must not abuse their dominant positions by
taking advantage of data and algorithms, technology, capital advantages, or platform rules."
Good Growth,"The heightened regulatory scrutiny of business operators under the relevant laws and regulations may increase our compliance costs,
divert significant management time and attention and our financial resources, and subject us to heightened risks and challenges."
Good Growth,"There is a risk that our employees could abuse their authority, for example, by entering into a contract not approved by us or seeking to gain control
of one of our subsidiaries."
Good Growth,"Any funds we transfer to our PRC subsidiaries, either as a shareholder loan or as an increase in registered capital, are subject to approval by or
registration with relevant governmental authorities in China."
Good Growth,"The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in
political and economic conditions and the foreign exchange policy adopted by the PRC government."
Good Growth,"It is difficult to predict how long such
depreciation of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar may last and when and how the relationship between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar may
change again."
Good Growth,"To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the
Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would receive."
Good Growth,"Conversely, if we decide to convert our
Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our Ordinary Shares, Senior Preferred Shares or the ADSs or for
other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount."
Good Growth,Certain PRC regulations may make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions.
Good Growth,"Such regulation
requires, among other things, that the MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor acquires
control of a PRC domestic enterprise or a foreign company with substantial PRC operations, if certain thresholds under the Provisions on
Thresholds for Prior Notification of Concentrations of Undertakings, issued by the State Council in 2008, are triggered."
Good Growth,"PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident beneficial
owners or our PRC subsidiaries to liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries’
ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect us."
Bad Growth,"If any PRC shareholder of such SPV fails to make the required registration
or to update the previously filed registration, the subsidiary of such SPV in China may be prohibited from distributing its profits or the proceeds
from any capital reduction, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV, and the SPV may also be prohibited from making additional capital
contributions into its subsidiary in China."
Good Growth,"Failure to complete the SAFE registrations may subject them to fines and legal sanctions, there may be additional restrictions on the ability of them
to exercise their stock options or remit proceeds gained from the sale of their stock into the PRC."
Bad Growth,"VAT is recorded as reduction of our revenue, which amounted to RMB564.6 million in 2021, RMB986.4 million in 2022, and
RMB1,896.2 million (US$267.1 million) in 2023."
Good Growth,"If our offshore companies are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, such classification could result
in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders and the ADS holders."
Good Growth,"Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside the PRC with its “de facto
management body” within the PRC is considered a “resident enterprise” and will be subject to the enterprise income tax on its global income at the
rate of 25%."
Good Growth,"The implementation rules define the term “de facto management body” as the body that exercises full and substantial control and
overall management over the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise."
Good Growth,"In 2009, the State Administration of
Taxation (the “SAT”) issued a circular, known as SAT Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the “de facto
management body” of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China."
Good Growth,"Although this circular applies only to offshore
enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the criteria set forth in
the circular may reflect the SAT’s general position on how the “de facto management body” text should be applied in determining the tax resident
status of all offshore enterprises."
Good Growth,"According to SAT Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded
as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its “de facto management body” in China, and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its global
income only if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; (ii)
decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the
PRC; (iii) the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and Board and shareholder resolutions are located or
maintained in the PRC; and (iv) at least 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC."
Good Growth,"We believe our offshore companies (i.e., our companies other than PRC subsidiaries and Former VIE) are not PRC resident enterprises for
PRC tax purposes."
Good Growth,"However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain
with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto management body.” If the PRC tax authorities determine that any of our offshore companies
is a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, we would be subject to PRC enterprise income on our worldwide income at the rate
of 25%."
Good Growth,"Furthermore, the Company would be required to withhold a 10% tax from dividends it pays to its shareholders that are non-resident
enterprises, including the holders of the ADSs."
Good Growth,"In addition, non-resident enterprise shareholders (including the ADS holders) may be subject to
PRC tax at a rate of 10% on gains realized on the sale or other disposition of the ADSs, Senior Preferred Shares or Ordinary Shares, if such income
is treated as sourced from within the PRC."
Good Growth,"Furthermore, if the Company is deemed a PRC resident enterprise, dividends paid to its non-PRC
individual shareholders (including the ADS holders) and any gain realized on the transfer of the ADSs, Senior Preferred Shares or Ordinary Shares
by such shareholders may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 20% (which, in the case of dividends, may be withheld at source by the Company)."
Good Growth,"These rates may be reduced by an applicable tax treaty, but it is unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of the Company would be able to obtain the
benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that the Company is treated as a PRC resident
enterprise."
Good Growth,We face uncertainty with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies.
Good Growth,"On February 3, 2015, the SAT issued the Public Notice Regarding Certain Corporate Income Tax Matters on Indirect Transfer of Properties by
Non-Tax Resident Enterprises (the “SAT Bulletin 7”)."
Good Growth,"52

Table of Contents

On October 17, 2017, the SAT issued the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Concerning the Withholding of
Non-resident Enterprise Income Tax at Source (the “SAT Bulletin 37”), which came into effect on December 1, 2017."
Good Growth,"The SAT Bulletin 37 further
clarifies the practice and procedure of the withholding of non-resident enterprise income tax."
Good Growth,"Where a non-resident enterprise transfers taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, which
is an Indirect Transfer, the non-resident enterprise as either transferor or transferee, or the PRC entity that directly owns the taxable assets, may
report such Indirect Transfer to the relevant tax authority."
Good Growth,"As a result, gains derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other
person who pays for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC
resident enterprise."
Good Growth,"For transfer of shares in our company by investors who are non-PRC resident
enterprises, our PRC subsidiaries may be requested to assist in the filing under SAT Bulletin 7 and/or SAT Bulletin 37."

The trading price of the ADSs has been and may continue to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors."
Bad Growth,"The securities of some Chinabased companies that have listed their securities in the United States have experienced significant volatility since their initial public offerings in
recent years, including, in some cases, substantial declines in the trading prices of their securities."
Good Growth,"In the past, shareholders of public companies have often brought securities class action suits against those companies following periods of
instability in the market price of their securities."
Good Growth,"In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations."
Bad Growth,"Substantial future sales or perceived potential sales of ADSs in the public market or
other equity-linked securities could cause the price of ADSs to decline."
Bad Growth,"Sales of
these registered shares in the form of ADSs in the public market could cause the price of the ADSs to decline."
Good Growth,"We currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our
business."
Bad Growth,"The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities
between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than
it received in the sale."
Bad Growth,"As it is in the short seller’s interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the
publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate
profits for themselves after selling a security short."
Good Growth,"We have been and may in the future again become the subject of short selling, the target of harassing or other detrimental conduct by third
parties."
Good Growth,"Even if such allegations are ultimately proven to be groundless, allegations against
us could severely impact our business operations, and any investment in the ADSs could be greatly reduced or even rendered worthless."
Bad Growth,"57

If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the trading price
for the ADSs and trading volume could decline."
Bad Growth,"If research analysts do not establish and maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades
the ADSs or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the trading price for the ADSs would likely decline."
Bad Growth,"If one or more of
these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which, in
turn, could cause the trading price or trading volume for the ADSs to decline."
Bad Growth,"If our Board
decides to issue preferred shares, the trading price of the ADSs may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Ordinary Shares and
the ADSs may be materially and adversely affected."

Good Growth,"Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, rents, royalties and investment

Bad Growth,"However,
because our market capitalization declined significantly since the second quarter of 2020 and throughout 2020, there can be no assurance that the
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) will not assert that the true value of our goodwill for 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 is in fact lower."
Good Growth,"The deposit agreement governing the ADSs representing our Class A Ordinary Shares provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
ADS holders waive the right to a jury trial of any claim they may have against us or the depositary arising out of or relating to our shares, the ADSs
or the deposit agreement, including any claim under the U.S. federal securities laws."
Good Growth,"If you or any other holders or beneficial owners of ADSs bring a claim against us or the depositary in connection with matters arising under
the deposit agreement or the ADSs, including claims under federal securities laws, you or such other holder or beneficial owner may not be entitled
to a jury trial with respect to such claims, which may have the effect of limiting and discouraging lawsuits against us and/or the depositary."
Good Growth,"If a
lawsuit is brought against us and/or the depositary under the deposit agreement, it may be heard only by a judge or justice of the applicable trial
court, which would be conducted according to different civil procedures and may result in different outcomes than a trial by jury would have had,
including results that could be less favorable to the plaintiff(s) in any such action."
Good Growth,"In March 2018, Luckin Coffee Inc.
increased Ordinary Shares to 750 shares and effected a share split, pursuant to which, the 750 Ordinary Shares were subdivided into 750,000

Good Growth,"In addition, the commencement or continuation of suits, actions or proceedings in the territorial jurisdiction

Good Growth,"On February 24, 2023, the Provisions on Strengthening the Confidentiality and Archives Administration of Overseas Securities Issuance and
Listing by Domestic Enterprises was promulgated, or the Provision on Confidentiality, which became effective on March 31, 2023."

Discussion of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022
Net Revenues
Our net revenues were RMB24,903.2 million (US$3,507.5 million) in 2023, increasing by 87.3% from RMB13,293.0 million in 2022."
Good Growth,"The
growth of our net revenues was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of products sold, the increase in stores in operation and the
increase in the number of monthly transacting customers."
Good Growth,"In 2023, the net increase in the number of our self-operated stores
was 4,976, resulting in a year-over-year self-operated store unit growth of 88.0%, ending the year with 10,628 self-operated stores."
Good Growth,"The growth of our revenue from freshly brewed drinks was primarily driven by the increase in the number of our
freshly brewed drinks sold, the increase in stores in operation and the increase in the number of monthly transacting customers."
Good Growth,"(ii) Revenues from other products
Our net revenues from other products were RMB1,241.9 million (US$174.9 million) in 2023, increasing by 80.8% from RMB686.8 million in
2022, primarily driven by the increase in the number of non-freshly brewed items sold and the increase in products sold through e-commerce
platforms."
Good Growth,"(iii) Revenues from others
Our revenues from others increased by 21.9% from RMB457.5 million in 2022 to RMB557.6 million (US$78.5 million) in 2023, primarily as
a result of our increased delivery service fees derived from self-operated stores due to the increase of number of delivery orders and increased
revenue from membership service."
Good Growth,"Our revenues from partnership stores in 2023 increased by 102.8% from RMB3,069.3 million in 2022."
Good Growth,"The growth of our revenues from
partnership stores was primarily driven by the significant increase in the number of our partnership stores and items sold."
Good Growth,"The growth of
our operating expenses was generally in line with our business expansion."
Good Growth,"Meanwhile, our operating expenses as a percentage of our net revenues
decreased from 91.3% in 2022 to 87.9% in 2023, mainly driven by the increased economies of scale and our technology-driven operations, which
was partially offset by the increase in cost of materials as a percentage of net revenues resulting from the decreased average selling price of the
Company’s products."
Good Growth,"The increase in the
cost of materials was in line with the increase in the number of products sold and the increase in sales of materials to partnership stores."
Good Growth,"The increased store rental and other operating costs in 2023 were primarily attributable to the increased expenses in relation to labor costs, the
increased number of stores we operated and increased number of items sold."

Our depreciation and amortization expenses increased from RMB391.9 million in 2022 to RMB604.6 million (US$85.2 million) in 2023,
primarily due to the increase in amortization of leasehold improvements for the stores and the increase in depreciation expenses of additional
equipment put into use in new stores in 2023."
Good Growth,"Delivery expenses
Our delivery expenses increased from RMB1,373.2 million in 2022 to RMB2,010.7 million (US$283.2 million) in 2023, primarily due to the
increased number of delivery orders."
Good Growth,"The
increase in sales and marketing expenses mainly driven by (i) an increase in advertising expenses as we continued to make strategic investments in
our branding through various channels, (ii) an increase in subcontract service fees to support our business in certain channels, and (iii) an increase
in commission fees to third-party delivery platforms which is in line with the increase in the number of delivery orders."
Good Growth,"The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly driven by increases in (i) payroll costs for headquarters staff, (ii) expenditures for
office supplies, (iii) tax surcharges and stamp duties and (iv) research and development expenses, which was offset by the decrease of share-based
compensation for restricted share units and options issued to management and employees."
Good Growth,"Our
store preopening and other expenses increased in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to the increased rental costs for new store openings as we opened
more stores in 2023."
Bad Growth,"Impairment loss of long-lived assets
Our impairment loss of long-lived assets was RMB5.2 million (US$0.7 million) in 2023, compared to RMB221.8 million in 2022."
Bad Growth,"The
impairment loss of long-lived assets in 2023 provided for a full impairment for assets in relation to Luckin Tea as we permanently closed Luckin
Tea stores and ceased all Luckin Tea operations, while the impairment loss of long-lived assets in 2022 was provided for a full impairment for
Luckin Coffee EXPRESS machines due to historical underperformance and updated strategy and business projections for Luckin Coffee EXPRESS
machines determined by the management."
Bad Growth,"Losses and expenses related to Fabricated Transactions and Restructuring
We incurred losses and expenses related to Fabricated Transactions and Restructuring in a total amount of negative RMB28.5 million (negative
US$4.0 million) in 2023, compared to RMB75.2 million in 2022, as in 2023 we reversed RMB44.7 million (US$6.3 million) of accrued
professional service fees following the settlement with certain underwriters relating to indemnification of their defense costs in connection with the
Fabricated Transactions."
Good Growth,"The increase
of interest income was mainly due to the increase in our average monthly cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and
term deposits as we earned more profits in 2023."
Good Growth,"Foreign Exchange Gain, Net
We recorded net foreign exchange gain of RMB3.0 million (US$0.4 million) in 2023, compared to net foreign exchange gain of RMB10.7
million in 2022."
Bad Growth,"The net other income in 2022 and 2023 was primarily attributable to the government grants, partially offset by donations and loss from asset
disposals."
Bad Growth,"Where available information indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred as of the
date of the consolidated financial statements and the Company can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the Company accrues a provision
for that loss in accordance with relevant U.S. GAAP principles."
Bad Growth,"The Company’s estimate of probable losses from these litigations is based on either
the amount of a settlement (if a settlement has been reached), the Company’s most recent offer made to a claimant (if no settlement has been
reached but settlement negotiations have begun) or the implied recovery represented by the Federal Class Action Settlement (where no settlement
negotiations have begun)."
Bad Growth,The actual loss could be greater or smaller than our current estimate.
Bad Growth,"Income Tax Expense
The income tax expenses decreased from RMB638.5 million in 2022 to RMB259.4 million in 2023 mainly because in accordance with
relevant accounting standards, we re-evaluated the realization of deferred tax assets given the largely reduced uncertainty of our business
performance after a certain number of our operation entities have turned cumulative losses into cumulative profits in 2023."
Bad Growth,"Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In evaluating the business, we consider and use adjusted operating (loss)/income and adjusted net (loss)/income, each a non-GAAP financial
measure, in reviewing and assessing our operating performance."
Bad Growth,"118

Table of Contents

We define non-GAAP operating (loss)/income as operating (loss)/income excluding share-based compensation expenses and impairment loss
of long-lived assets."
Good Growth,"We define non-GAAP net (loss)/income as net (loss)/income excluding share-based compensation expenses, fair value changes
of derivative asset bifurcated from Series B Senior Secured Notes, impairment loss of long-lived assets, provision/(reversal) for SEC settlement,
provision for equity litigants settlement and gain from extinguishment of Series B Senior Secured Notes."
Good Growth,"We define non-GAAP net (loss)/income
attributable to our company’s ordinary shareholders as net (loss)/income attributable to our company’s ordinary shareholders excluding share-based

provision/(reversal) for SEC settlement, provision for equity litigants settlement and gain from extinguishment of Series B Senior Secured Notes."
Bad Growth,"Starting from the third quarter of 2021, we recorded impairment loss of long-lived assets primarily in the ordinary course of business, rather than
unexpected events such as store closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic."
Bad Growth,"Therefore, we no longer adjust for such impairment loss of longlived assets in our non-GAAP measures since then."
Bad Growth,"The table below sets forth a reconciliation of our operating (loss)/income to non-GAAP
operating (loss)/income, our net (loss)/income to non- GAAP net (loss)/income, our net (loss)/income attributable to our company’s ordinary
shareholders to non-GAAP net (loss)/income attributable to our company’s ordinary shareholders for the years indicated below."

Our principal source of liquidity has been cash provided by our operating activities and historical equity financing activities, including the
proceeds from our IPO in May 2019, and our follow-on public offering and convertible note offering in January 2020, and the Investment
Agreement with an affiliate of Centurium Capital and Joy Capital."
Good Growth,"Our operating expenses continued to increase historically and are expected to continue to increase in
line with our business expansion."
Good Growth,"Meanwhile, leveraging our new retail model, we experienced robust growth in net revenues in 2021, 2022, and
2023."
Good Growth,"As a result of increased economies of scale and technology-driven operations, our operating expenses as a percentage of our net revenues
decreased from 106.8% in 2021 to 91.3% in 2022, and further to 87.9% in 2023."
Bad Growth,"Our operating loss in 2021, which represented 6.8% of our net
revenues, turned into an operating profit in 2022 and 2023, representing 8.7% and 12.1% of our net revenues, respectively."
Good Growth,"Nevertheless, as we
continue to focus on business growth and expansion, our operating expenses in absolute amounts are expected to continue to increase in the near
future."
Good Growth,"Our net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 reflected a net income of RMB2,847.9 million
(US$401.1 million), adjusted by (i) the add back of non-cash items mainly consisting of amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets of
RMB1,399.2 million (US$197.1 million), depreciation and amortization of RMB604.6 million (US$85.2 million), share-based compensation
expenses of RMB239.5 million (US$33.7 million), impairment of long-lived assets of RMB5.2 million (US$0.7 million), which was (ii) partially
offset by the accrual of deferred tax assets of RMB141.6 million (US$19.9 million), the reversal of allowance for receivables of RMB3.2 million
(US$0.5 million), foreign exchange gain of RMB3.0 million (US$0.4 million) and changes in operating assets and liabilities of RMB2,061.0
million (US$290.3 million)."
Good Growth,"The change in operating assets and liabilities mainly arises from the increase in payment of equity litigants settlement
of RMB84.3 million (US$11.9 million) resulting from the payment to certain litigants of RMB7.8 million and a provision for equity litigants of
RMB92.2 million, the decrease of operating lease liabilities of RMB1,442.0 million (US$203.1 million), the increase of inventories of RMB988.3
million (US$139.2 million), and the increase of accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets and other non-current assets of
RMB727.3 million (US$102.4 million), partially offset by the increase of accounts payable of RMB373.2 million (US$52.6 million) and the
increase of accrued expenses and other liabilities of RMB 675.3 million (US$95.1 million)."
Good Growth,"Our subsidiaries in China are permitted to pay dividends to us only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with the
Accounting Standards for Business Enterprise as promulgated by the Ministry of Finance of the PRC, or PRC GAAP."
Good Growth,"Before January 1, 2020,
pursuant to the law applicable to China’s foreign investment enterprise, our subsidiaries that are foreign investment enterprises in the PRC have to
make appropriation from their after-tax profit, as determined under PRC GAAP, to reserve funds including (i) the general reserve fund, (ii) the
enterprise expansion fund and (iii) the staff bonus and welfare fund."
Good Growth,"On January 1, 2020, the Foreign Investment Law
and the Implementation Regulations came into effect, which repealed the PRC Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law and the Implementation
Regulations on the Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law and became the legal foundation for foreign investment in the PRC."
Good Growth,"However, according to the Foreign Investment Law and the Implementation Regulations, the
foreign investment enterprises established before January 1, 2020 may elect to maintain their current corporate governance rules, including the
dividend distribution policy, adopted under the PRC Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law, within five years after January 1, 2020."
Good Growth,"Such direct loans to the nominee shareholders would be
eliminated in our consolidated financial statements against the Former VIE’s share capital."
Good Growth,"(3) The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law imposes a withholding income tax of 10% on dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise, or
FIE, to its immediate holding company outside of China if such immediate holding company is considered as a non-resident enterprise without
any establishment or place within China or if the received dividends have no connection with the establishment or place of such immediate
holding company within China, unless such immediate holding company’s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that
provides for a different withholding arrangement."

Subject to the Companies Act and the articles of association, the Company shall have power to redeem or purchase any of its Shares and to

●

Good Growth,"Cayman Islands Taxation
The Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation, and there is no
taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty."
Good Growth,"154

Table of Contents

Pursuant to the Tax Concessions Act of the Cayman Islands, the Company has obtained an undertaking: (i) that no law that is enacted in the
Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciation shall apply to the Company or its operations; and (ii) that
the aforesaid tax or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall not be payable on or in respect of the shares, debentures or other
obligations of the Company."
Good Growth,"People’s Republic of China Taxation
Under the PRC EIT Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008 and most recently amended on December 29, 2018, an enterprise
established outside the PRC with “de facto management bodies” within the PRC is considered a “resident enterprise” for PRC enterprise income
tax purposes and is generally subject to a uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on its worldwide income."
Good Growth,"Under the implementation rules to the
PRC EIT Law, a “de facto management body” is defined as a body that has material and overall management and control over the manufacturing
and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and properties of an enterprise."
Good Growth,"In addition, the SAT Circular 82 issued by the SAT in April 2009 specifies that certain offshore incorporated enterprises controlled by PRC
enterprises or PRC enterprise groups will be classified as PRC resident enterprises if the following are located or resident in the PRC: (a) senior
management personnel and departments that are responsible for daily production, operation and management; (b) financial and personnel decisionmaking bodies; (c) key properties, accounting books, company seal, minutes of board meetings and shareholders’ meetings; and (d) half or more of
the senior management or directors having voting rights."
Good Growth,"As such, we do not believe that the
Company meets all of the conditions above or is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes."
Good Growth,"For the same reasons, we believe our other
offshore companies are not PRC resident enterprises either."
Good Growth,"However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC
tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto management body.” There can be no assurance that
the PRC government will ultimately take a view that is consistent with our position."
Good Growth,"If the PRC tax authorities determine that our Cayman Islands
holding company is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a 10% withholding tax would be imposed on dividends it
pays to its non-PRC enterprise shareholders (including the ADS holders) if such dividends are deemed to be sourced within the PRC."
Good Growth,"In addition,
non-PRC resident enterprise shareholders (including the ADS holders) may be subject to PRC tax on gains realized on the sale or other disposition
of ADSs or Ordinary Shares at a rate of 10%, if such income is treated as sourced from within the PRC."
Good Growth,"Furthermore, if the Company is deemed a
PRC resident enterprise, dividends paid to its non-PRC individual shareholders (including the ADS holders) and any gain realized on the transfer of
ADSs or Ordinary Shares by such shareholders may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 20% (which, in the case of dividends, may be withheld at
source by us) if such dividends or gains are deemed to be sourced within the PRC."
Good Growth,"These rates may be reduced by an applicable tax treaty, but it is
unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of the Company would be able to obtain the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax
residence and the PRC in the event that the Company is treated as a PRC resident enterprise."
Good Growth,"Risk Factors—
Risks Relating to Doing Business in China—If our offshore companies are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax
purposes, such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders and the ADS holders”
U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
The following are material U.S. federal income tax consequences to the U.S. Holders described below of owning and disposing of our ADSs or
Class A Ordinary Shares, but this discussion does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be
relevant to a particular person’s decision to own our ADSs or Class A Ordinary Shares."
Good Growth,"Accordingly, no gain or loss will be recognized if a U.S. Holder exchanges ADSs for the underlying Class A
Ordinary Shares represented by those ADSs."
Good Growth,"Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, rents, royalties and investment
gains."
Bad Growth,"However,
because our market capitalization declined significantly since the second quarter of 2020 and throughout 2020, there can be no assurance that the
IRS will not assert that the true value of our goodwill for 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 is in fact lower."
Good Growth,"157

Table of Contents

In general, if we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder owns ADSs or Class A Ordinary Shares, gain recognized by the
U.S. Holder on a sale or other disposition (including certain pledges) of its ADSs or Class A Ordinary Shares will be allocated ratably over that
U.S. Holder’s holding period."
Good Growth,"If the dividend is converted into U.S. dollars on the
date of receipt, a U.S. Holder generally should not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the amount received."
Good Growth,"A U.S.
Holder may have foreign currency gain or loss if the dividend is converted into U.S. dollars after the date of receipt."
Good Growth,"Subject to applicable limitations, which vary depending upon the U.S.
Holder’s circumstances, and the discussion below regarding certain Treasury regulations, PRC taxes withheld from dividend payments (at a rate not
exceeding the applicable Treaty rate in the case of U.S. Holders that qualify for the benefits of the Treaty) generally will be creditable against a
U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability."
Good Growth,"A U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss on a sale or other taxable disposition of ADSs or Class A Ordinary Shares in an amount
equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or other taxable disposition and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such ADSs or Class
A Ordinary Shares disposed of, in each case as determined in U.S. dollars."
Good Growth,"The gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of
the sale or disposition, the U.S. Holder has owned the ADSs or Class A Ordinary Shares for more than one year."
Good Growth,"Long-term capital gains
recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders may be subject to a tax rate that is lower than the rate applicable to ordinary income."
Bad Growth,"The deductibility of
capital losses is subject to limitations."
Good Growth,"As described in “Taxation—People’s Republic of China Taxation,” gains on the sale of ADSs or Class A Ordinary Shares may be subject to
PRC taxes."
Good Growth,"Under the Code, capital gains of U.S. persons are generally treated as U.S.-source income."
Good Growth,"However, a U.S. Holder that is eligible for
Treaty benefits may be able to elect to treat gains on the disposition of ADSs or Class A Ordinary Shares as foreign-source income under the Treaty
and claim a foreign tax credit in respect of any PRC taxes on such disposition gains."
Good Growth,"Under certain Treasury regulations, a U.S. Holder will
generally be precluded from claiming a foreign tax credit with respect to PRC income taxes on gains from dispositions of ADSs or Class A
Ordinary Shares unless the U.S. Holder is eligible for Treaty benefits and elects to apply them."
Good Growth,"Even if these Treasury regulations do not prohibit a U.S. Holder from claiming
a foreign tax credit with respect to any PRC income tax on disposition gains, other limitations under the foreign tax credit rules may preclude a
U.S. Holder from claiming a foreign tax credit, in whole or in part, with respect to such taxes."
Good Growth,"If a U.S. Holder is precluded from claiming a foreign
tax credit with respect to any PRC income taxes on disposition gains, it is possible that such PRC taxes on disposition gains may either be
deductible or reduce the amount realized on the disposition."
Good Growth,"U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the consequences of the imposition of any PRC tax on disposition gains, including the
Treaty’s resourcing rule, any reporting requirements with respect to a Treaty-based return position and the creditability or deductibility of the PRC
tax on disposition gains in their particular circumstances (including any applicable limitations)."
Good Growth,"The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to
a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle it to a refund, provided that the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS."
Good Growth,"Dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would
reduce the Renminbi amount we receive from the conversion."
Good Growth,"Conversely, if we decide to convert Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of
making payments for dividends on our Ordinary Shares, Senior Preferred Shares, or ADSs, servicing our outstanding debt, or for other business
purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would reduce the U.S. dollar amounts available to us."
Good Growth,"Cybersecurity
At Luckin Coffee, cybersecurity risk management is an integral part of our overall enterprise risk management program."
Good Growth,"As of December 31, 2023, the valuation allowance of RMB442.7 million was provided
against the deferred income tax assets of certain subsidiaries, which were not able to utilize portion or all of the benefits of the deferred tax assets
due to lack of sufficient sources of qualified taxable income."
Good Growth,"The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
●

Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions of continued profitability of certain subsidiaries and expected
utilization of deferred tax assets against current and past performance of those subsidiaries and whether such assumptions were consistent with
evidence obtained in other areas of the audit."

LUCKIN COFFEE INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
(Amounts in thousands of RMB and US$, except for number of shares and per share data)
2."
Bad Growth,"Accounting estimates reflected in the Group’s consolidated financial statements include, but not limited to, estimates for allowance for credit
losses of accounts receivable and other receivables, inventory provision, and short-term investments, useful lives and impairment of long-lived
assets, revenue recognized from breakage amount, refund liability, accounting for deferred income taxes and uncertain tax benefits, valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets, fair value of share-based payments, provision of contingent liabilities, and valuations for derivative financial
instruments, convertible senior preferred shares and convertible senior notes."
Good Growth,Exchange gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
Good Growth,"Accounts receivable that are ultimately
deemed to be uncollectible, and for which collection efforts have been exhausted, are written off against the allowance for credit losses."
Bad Growth,"As of
December 31, 2022 and 2023, the allowance for credit losses for the Group’s account receivable was RMB0.2 million and RMB nil million
(US$nil), respectively."
Bad Growth,"(l)

Expected Credit Losses

The Group’s account receivable, receivables from online payment platforms, other receivables and other certain financial assets are within the
scope of ASU No."
Bad Growth,"The Group maintains an estimated allowance for credit losses to reduce them to the amount that it believes will be
collected."
Bad Growth,"When developing an estimation of expected credit losses, the Group applies the historical loss experience with appropriate
adjustment."
Bad Growth,"If there is strong evidence indicating that these financial assets are likely to be unrecoverable, the Group also makes specific
allowance in the period in which a loss is determined to be probable."
Good Growth,"(n)

Property and equipment

Property and equipment primarily consist of office buildings, store operating equipment, mechanical equipment, leasehold improvements,
office equipment and others."
Good Growth,"Property
and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
Category

Store operating equipment
Office equipment and others
Leasehold improvements
Mechanical equipment
Office buildings

Estimated useful life

5 years
3-5 years
Over the shorter of lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets
10 years
40-50 years

Direct costs that are related to the construction of property and equipment and incurred in connection with bringing the assets to their intended
use are capitalized as construction in progress."
Good Growth,"Retirements, sale and disposals of assets are recorded by removing the cost,
accumulated depreciation and relevant impairment, with any resulting gain or loss reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income."
Bad Growth,"If the
sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group is less than the carrying amount of the assets or the asset groups, the
Group recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets or the asset groups over their fair value."
Bad Growth,"Impairment loss of long-lived assets mainly represented RMB21.4 million for the asset group related to store operating equipment and others
for the year ended December 31, 2021, and RMB221.8 million for the asset group related to Luckin Coffee EXPRESS machines for the year
ended December 31, 2022 and RMB5.2 million mainly for the assets in relation to Luckin Tea for the year ended December 31, 2023."
Bad Growth,"Allowance for partnership stores is accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price, which is usually
determined upon the completion of each order."
Bad Growth,"Price
concession for profit-sharing is accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price and deducts the revenue directly."
Good Growth,"Other expenses include lease exit costs, such as
the write offs of prepaid store rental costs, deposits and leasehold improvements."
Good Growth,"Operating lease ROU assets
The right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, which comprise the initial amounts of the lease liabilities adjusted for any lease payments
made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and less any lease incentive received."
Good Growth,"Lease payments included in the
measurement of the lease liabilities comprise fixed lease payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate and any exercise
price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise."
Good Growth,"The Group’s AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, it is contractually obligated to
remove in order to comply with the lease agreement."
Good Growth,"Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is
recognized as a gain or loss in store rental and other operating expenses on its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
income."
Bad Growth,"The government subsidies with no further conditions to be met are recognized as income in “Other income/(expenses),

at least one of those measures is determined in a way that is most consistent with the measurement principles used to measure the
corresponding amounts in the consolidated financial statements."
Good Growth,"In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures."
