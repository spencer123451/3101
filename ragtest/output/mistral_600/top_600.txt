"Domitius Marsus (/ˈmɑːrsəs/) was a Latin poet, friend of Virgil and Tibullus, and contemporary of Horace.

"Cadmium is a chemical element with the symbol Cd and atomic number 48. This soft, silvery-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12, zinc and mercury. Like zinc, it demonstrates oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the transition metals in groups 3 through 11. Cadmium and its congeners in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by Stromeyer and Hermann, both in Germany, as an impurity in zinc carbonate."	http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Cadmium_cutoff.png?width=300	Cadmium	https://dbpedia.org/page/Cadmium	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium?oldid=1122440781&ns=0

"A main battle tank (MBT), also known as a battle tank or universal tank, is a tank that fills the role of armor-protected direct fire and maneuver in many modern armies. Cold War-era development of more powerful engines, better suspension systems and lighter-weight composite armor allowed the design of a tank that had the firepower of a super-heavy tank, the armor protection of a heavy tank, and the mobility of a light tank, in a package with the weight of a medium tank. Through the 1960s and 1970s, the MBT replaced almost all other types of tanks, leaving only some specialist roles to be filled by lighter designs or other types of armored fighting vehicles."	http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Leopard_2_A5_der_Bundeswehr.jpg?width=300	Main battle tank	https://dbpedia.org/page/Main_battle_tank	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_battle_tank?oldid=1124931569&ns=0
