"Cadmium is a chemical element with the symbol Cd and atomic number 48. This soft, silvery-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12, zinc and mercury. Like zinc, it demonstrates oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the transition metals in groups 3 through 11. Cadmium and its congeners in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by Stromeyer and Hermann, both in Germany, as an impurity in zinc carbonate."	http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Cadmium_cutoff.png?width=300	Cadmium	https://dbpedia.org/page/Cadmium	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium?oldid=1122440781&ns=0

"A main battle tank (MBT), also known as a battle tank or universal tank, is a tank that fills the role of armor-protected direct fire and maneuver in many modern armies. Cold War-era development of more powerful engines, better suspension systems and lighter-weight composite armor allowed the design of a tank that had the firepower of a super-heavy tank, the armor protection of a heavy tank, and the mobility of a light tank, in a package with the weight of a medium tank. Through the 1960s and 1970s, the MBT replaced almost all other types of tanks, leaving only some specialist roles to be filled by lighter designs or other types of armored fighting vehicles."	http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Leopard_2_A5_der_Bundeswehr.jpg?width=300	Main battle tank	https://dbpedia.org/page/Main_battle_tank	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_battle_tank?oldid=1124931569&ns=0

If the conditions of scarcity didn't exist and an ""infinite amount of every good could be produced or human wants fully satisfied ... there would be no economic goods, i.e. goods that are relatively scarce..."" Scarcity is the limited availability of a commodity, which may be in demand in the market or by the commons. Scarcity also includes an individual's lack of resources to buy commodities. The opposite of scarcity is abundance."

"Structural analysis is a branch of Solid Mechanics which uses simplified models for solids like bars, beams and shells for engineering decision making. Its main objective is to determine the effect of loads on the physical structures and their components. In contrast to theory of elasticity, the models used in structure analysis are often differential equations in one spatial variable. Structures subject to this type of analysis include all that must withstand loads, such as buildings, bridges, aircraft and ships. Structural analysis uses ideas from applied mechanics, materials science and applied mathematics to compute a structure's deformations, internal forces, stresses, support reactions, velocity, accelerations, and stability. The results of the analysis are used to verify a structure"	"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Truss_Structure_Analysis,_Full_Figure2.jpg?width=300"	Structural analysis	https://dbpedia.org/page/Structural_analysis	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analysis?oldid=1111332790&ns=0

Mimicry evolves if a receiver (such as a predator) perceives the similarity between a mimic (the organism that has a resemblance) and a model (the organism it resembles) and as a result changes its behaviour in a way that provides a selective advantage to the mimic. The resemblances that evolve in mimicry can be visual, acoustic, chemical, tactile, or electric, or combinations of these sensory modalities.

"An anti-tank gun is a form of artillery designed to destroy tanks and other armored fighting vehicles, normally from a static defensive position. The development of specialized anti-tank munitions and anti-tank guns was prompted by the appearance of tanks during World War I. To destroy hostile tanks, artillerymen often used field guns depressed to fire directly at their targets, but this practice expended too much valuable ammunition and was of increasingly limited effectiveness as tank armor became thicker. The first dedicated anti-tank artillery began appearing in the 1920s, and by World War II was a common appearance in many European armies. To penetrate armor, they fired specialized ammunition from longer barrels to achieve a higher muzzle velocity than field guns.

"A monograph is a specialist work of writing (in contrast to reference works) or exhibition on a single subject or an aspect of a subject, often by a single author or artist, and usually on a scholarly subject. In library cataloging, monograph has a broader meaning—that of a nonserial publication complete in one volume (book) or a definite number of volumes. Thus it differs from a serial or periodical publication such as a magazine, academic journal, or newspaper. In this context only, books such as novels are considered monographs."	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:About	Monograph	https://dbpedia.org/page/Monograph	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monograph?oldid=1122471930&ns=0

Literally, an inquisitor is one who ""searches out"" or ""inquires"" (Latin inquirere < quaerere, 'to seek'). Inquisitors sought out the social networks that people used to spread heresy. There were accounts where the Inquisition could not tell who was a heretic or devout, and they were killed anyway. One of these accounts was Arnaud Amalric at the storming of Béziers. The abbot was recorded as saying “Kill them.

"Buoyancy (/ˈbɔɪənsi, ˈbuːjənsi/), or upthrust, is an upward force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of a partially or fully immersed object. In a column of fluid, pressure increases with depth as a result of the weight of the overlying fluid. Thus the pressure at the bottom of a column of fluid is greater than at the top of the column. Similarly, the pressure at the bottom of an object submerged in a fluid is greater than at the top of the object. The pressure difference results in a net upward force on the object. The magnitude of the force is proportional to the pressure difference, and (as explained by Archimedes' principle) is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the submerged volume of the object, i.e. the displaced fluid."	http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Buoyancy.svg?width=300	Buoyancy	https://dbpedia.org/page/Buoyancy	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy?oldid=1119482061&ns=0

"Beatrix of Brandenburg (died 22 September 1314 in Wismar) was the first wife of Lord Henry II ""the Lion"" of Mecklenburg (1266–1329), whom she married in 1292 at Stargard Castle. Beatrix was the daughter of Margrave Albert III of Brandenburg and his wife, Matilda of Denmark. Their wedding in 1292 is historically significant because Beatrix brought the Lordship of Stargard as dowry into the marriage and thus into the hands of Mecklenburg. Beatrix's marriage did not produce a male heir, so the Ascanians reckoned Stargard fell back to Brandenburg when she died. Mecklenburg disagreed and this led to the so-called """". Mecklenburg won and under the terms of the Treaty of Templin of 1317, Stargard definitively became part of Mecklenburg."

"James Jerome Gibson (/ˈɡɪbsən/; January 27, 1904 – December 11, 1979), was an American psychologist and is considered to be one of the most important contributors to the field of visual perception. Gibson challenged the idea that the nervous system actively constructs conscious visual perception, and instead promoted ecological psychology, in which the mind directly perceives environmental stimuli without additional cognitive construction or processing. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked him as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, David Rumelhart, Louis Leon Thurstone, Margaret Floy Washburn, and Robert S.

"In Belgium, the French Community (French: Communauté française; French pronunciation: ​[kɔmynote fʁɑ̃sɛːz]) refers to one of the three constituent constitutional linguistic communities. Since 2011, the French Community has used the name Wallonia-Brussels Federation (French: Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles), which is controversial because its name in the Belgian constitution has not changed and because it is seen as a political statement. The name ""French Community"" refers to Francophone Belgians, and not to French people residing in Belgium. As such, the French Community of Belgium is sometimes rendered in English as ""the French-speaking Community of Belgium"" for clarity, in analogy to the German-speaking Community of Belgium."	http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Community_of_Belgium__PoliticalFunction__1	French Community of Belgium	https://dbpedia.org/page/French_Community_of_Belgium	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Community_of_Belgium?oldid=1109271552&ns=0

Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism.

"In physics, mathematics, and related fields, a wave is a propagating dynamic disturbance (change from equilibrium) of one or more quantities. Waves can be periodic, in which case those quantities oscillate repeatedly about an equilibrium (resting) value at some frequency. When the entire waveform moves in one direction, it is said to be a traveling wave; by contrast, a pair of superimposed periodic waves traveling in opposite directions makes a standing wave. In a standing wave, the amplitude of vibration has nulls at some positions where the wave amplitude appears smaller or even zero. Waves are often described by a wave equation (standing wave field of two opposite waves) or a one-way wave equation for single wave propagation in a defined direction."	http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/2006-01-14_Surface_waves.jpg?width=300	Wave	https://dbpedia.org/page/Wave	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave?oldid=1124143887&ns=0

It featured a duroplast body mounted on a one-piece steel chassis (a so-called unibody), front-wheel drive, a transverse two-stroke engine, and independent suspension. Because this 1950s design remained largely unchanged until the introduction of the last Trabant model, the Trabant 1.1 in 1990, the Trabant became symbolic of the former East Germany's stagnant economy and the collapse of the Eastern Bloc in general.

"A Congreve clock (also known as Congreve's Rolling Ball Clock or Oscillating Path Rolling Ball Clock) is a type of clock that uses a ball rolling along a zigzag track rather than a pendulum to regulate the time. It was invented by Sir William Congreve in 1808. The ball takes between 15 seconds and one minute to run down the zigzag track, where it trips the escapement which in turn reverses the tilt of the tray and at the same time causes the hands of the clock to move forward. Thus the angle of the plate reverses and the clock hands move forward between one and four times every minute. On versions of the clock with a dial to indicate seconds, the second hand jumps forward either 15 or 30 seconds on each oscillation depending on the length of the track."	http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Congreve-fig4.gif?width=300	Congreve clock	https://dbpedia.org/page/Congreve_clock	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congreve_clock?oldid=1063607586&ns=0

"Anti-tank warfare originated from the need to develop technology and tactics to destroy tanks during World War I. Since the Triple Entente deployed the first tanks in 1916, the German Empire developed the first anti-tank weapons.

Likely from Athens, she is most famous for instigating the burning of Persepolis. At the time, Thaïs was the lover of Ptolemy I Soter, one of Alexander's close companions and generals. It has been suggested that she may also have been Alexander's lover, on the basis of Athenaeus's statement that Alexander liked to ""keep Thaïs with him"", but this may simply mean he enjoyed her company, as she is said to have been very witty and entertaining. Athenaeus also says that after Alexander's death Ptolemy married Thaïs, who bore three of his children, and may also have become a Queen of Egypt."	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eurydice_II_of_Macedon	Thaïs	https://dbpedia.org/page/Tha%C3%AFs	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaïs?oldid=1122987090&ns=0

"In psychology, temperament broadly refers to consistent individual differences in behavior that are biologically based and are relatively independent of learning, system of values and attitudes. Some researchers point to association of temperament with formal dynamical features of behavior, such as energetic aspects, plasticity, sensitivity to specific reinforcers and emotionality. Temperament traits (such as Neuroticism, Sociability, Impulsivity, etc.) are distinct patterns in behavior throughout a lifetime, but they are most noticeable and most studied in children. Babies are typically described by temperament, but longitudinal research in the 1920s began to establish temperament as something which is stable across the lifespan."	https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/magazine/04anxiety-t.html%3F_r=1&ref=magazine	Temperament	https://dbpedia.org/page/Temperament	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperament?oldid=1124864067&ns=0

"Hypertonia is a term sometimes used synonymously with spasticity and rigidity in the literature surrounding damage to the central nervous system, namely upper motor neuron lesions. Impaired ability of damaged motor neurons to regulate descending pathways gives rise to disordered spinal reflexes, increased excitability of muscle spindles, and decreased synaptic inhibition. These consequences result in abnormally increased muscle tone of symptomatic muscles. Some authors suggest that the current definition for spasticity, the velocity-dependent over-activity of the stretch reflex, is not sufficient as it fails to take into account patients exhibiting increased muscle tone in the absence of stretch reflex over-activity. They instead suggest that ""reversible hypertonia"" is more appropriate and"	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Diseases_of_myoneural_junction_and_muscle	Hypertonia	https://dbpedia.org/page/Hypertonia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertonia?oldid=1119632318&ns=0

"Cortisol is a steroid hormone, in the glucocorticoid class of hormones. When used as a medication, it is known as hydrocortisone. It is produced in many animals, mainly by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland. It is produced in other tissues in lower quantities. It is released with a diurnal cycle and its release is increased in response to stress and low blood-glucose concentration. It functions to increase blood sugar through gluconeogenesis, to suppress the immune system, and to aid in the metabolism of fat, protein, and carbohydrates. It also decreases bone formation. Many of these functions are carried out by cortisol binding to glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid receptors inside the cell, which then bind to DNA to impact gene expression."	http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/Spectrums/925c5612-4ecd-461b-bb52-173189b86299.aspx	Cortisol	https://dbpedia.org/page/Cortisol	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol?oldid=1124365550&ns=0

"In the theory of capital structure, internal financing is the process of a firm using its profits or assets as a source of capital to fund a new project or investment. Internal sources of finance contrast with external sources of finance. The main difference between the two is that internal financing refers to the business generating funds from activities and assets that already exist in the company whereas external financing requires the involvement of a third party. Internal financing is generally thought to be less expensive for the firm than external financing because the firm does not have to incur transaction costs to obtain it, nor does it have to pay the taxes associated with paying dividends.

Its principal new feature is the concept of type extension of record types. It permits constructing new data types on the basis of existing ones and to relate them, deviating from the dogma of strictly static typing of data. Type extension is Wirth's way of inheritance reflecting the viewpoint of the parent site.

"Sententiae, the nominative plural of the Latin word sententia, are brief moral sayings, such as proverbs, adages, aphorisms, maxims, or apophthegms taken from ancient or popular or other sources, often quoted without context. Sententia, the nominative singular, also called a ""sentence"", is a kind of rhetorical proof. Through the invocation of a proverb, quotation, or witty turn of phrase during a presentation or conversation one may be able to gain the assent of the listener, who will hear a kind of non-logical, but agreed-upon truth in what one is saying. An example of this is the phrase ""age is better with wine"" playing off of the adage ""wine is better with age"". The same saying is present in Luke 5,39."	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Latin-stub	Sententia	https://dbpedia.org/page/Sententia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sententia?oldid=1078354858&ns=0

"Environmental history is the study of human interaction with the natural world over time, emphasising the active role nature plays in influencing human affairs and vice versa. Environmental history first emerged in the United States out of the environmental movement of the 1960s and 1970s, and much of its impetus still stems from present-day global environmental concerns. The field was founded on conservation issues but has broadened in scope to include more general social and scientific history and may deal with cities, population or sustainable development. As all history occurs in the natural world, environmental history tends to focus on particular time-scales, geographic regions, or key themes. It is also a strongly multidisciplinary subject that draws widely on both the humanities an"	http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/80_-_Machu_Picchu_-_Juin_2009_-_edit.2.jpg?width=300	Environmental history	https://dbpedia.org/page/Environmental_history	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_history?oldid=1116737595&ns=0

"A modern melodrama is a dramatic work in which the plot, typically sensationalized and for a strong emotional appeal, takes precedence over detailed characterization. Melodramas typically concentrate on dialogue that is often bombastic or excessively sentimental, rather than action. Characters are often flat, and written to fulfill stereotypes. Melodramas are typically set in the private sphere of the home, focusing on morality and family issues, love, and marriage, often with challenges from an outside source, such as a ""temptress"", a scoundrel, or an aristocratic villain. A melodrama on stage, filmed, or on television is usually accompanied by dramatic and suggestive music that offers cues to the audience of the drama being presented."	http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Honoré_Daumier_026.jpg?width=300	Melodrama	https://dbpedia.org/page/Melodrama	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodrama?oldid=1122857823&ns=0

"A living wage is defined as the minimum income necessary for a worker to meet their basic needs. This is not the same as a subsistence wage, which refers to a biological minimum, or a solidarity wage, which refers to a minimum wage tracking labor productivity. Needs are defined to include food, housing, and other essential needs such as clothing. The goal of a living wage is to allow a worker to afford a basic but decent standard of living through employment without government subsidies. Due to the flexible nature of the term ""needs"", there is not one universally accepted measure of what a living wage is and as such it varies by location and household type. A related concept is that of a family wage – one sufficient to not only support oneself, but also to raise a family."	http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Cost_of_Basic_but_Decent_Living.jpg?width=300	Living wage	https://dbpedia.org/page/Living_wage	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_wage?oldid=1122821582&ns=0

"A rocket engine uses stored rocket propellants as the reaction mass for forming a high-speed propulsive jet of fluid, usually high-temperature gas. Rocket engines are reaction engines, producing thrust by ejecting mass rearward, in accordance with Newton's third law. Most rocket engines use the combustion of reactive chemicals to supply the necessary energy, but non-combusting forms such as cold gas thrusters and nuclear thermal rockets also exist. Vehicles propelled by rocket engines are commonly called rockets. Rocket vehicles carry their own oxidiser, unlike most combustion engines, so rocket engines can be used in a vacuum to propel spacecraft and ballistic missiles."	http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/RS-68_rocket_engine_test.jpg?width=300	Rocket engine	https://dbpedia.org/page/Rocket_engine	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine?oldid=1121438400&ns=0

The term eternity clause is used in a similar manner in the constitutions of Brazil, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, India, Iran, Italy, Morocco, Norway, and Turkey, but specifically applies to an entrenched clause that can never be overridden. However, if a constitution provides for a mechanism of its own abolishment or replacement, like the German Basic Law does in Article 146, this by necessity provides a ""back door"" for getting rid of the ""eternity clause"", too."	https://web.archive.org/web/20140814175152/http:/www.law.georgetown.edu/cclt/documents/Schwartzberg_AgainstEntr.doc	Entrenched clause	https://dbpedia.org/page/Entrenched_clause	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrenched_clause?oldid=1123556005&ns=0

"A fossil fuel is a hydrocarbon-containing material formed naturally in the Earth's crust from the remains of dead plants and animals that is extracted and burned as a fuel. The main fossil fuels are coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels may be burned to provide heat for use directly (such as for cooking or heating), to power engines (such as internal combustion engines in motor vehicles), or to generate electricity. Some fossil fuels are refined into derivatives such as kerosene, gasoline and propane before burning. The origin of fossil fuels is the anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms, containing organic molecules created by photosynthesis. The conversion from these materials to high-carbon fossil fuels typically require a geological process of millions of years."	http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Chuhuo.jpg?width=300	Fossil fuel	https://dbpedia.org/page/Fossil_fuel	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel?oldid=1124816145&ns=0

(2008) as, “the rebound effect deals with the fact that improvements in efficiency often lead to cost reductions that provide the possibility to buy more of the improved product or other products or services.” A classic example from this perspective is a driver who substitutes a vehicle with a fuel-efficient version, only to reap the benefits of its lower operating expenses to commute longer and more fr"	http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Efficiencyreboundgraph.png?width=300	Rebound effect (conservation)	https://dbpedia.org/page/Rebound_effect_(conservation)	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_effect_(conservation)?oldid=1119473294&ns=0
