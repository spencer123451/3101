Let me tell you about them.\n\nFirst, there's Aurelian Durke Bataglani, an journalist from Bratina. He was held hostage in Firuzabad.\n\nSecond, we have Meggie Tazbah, a national and environmentalist from Bratina. She was also held hostage in Firuzabad.\n\nNow, regarding the hostage exchange, it was brokered by Quintara. This could be either Quintara negotiating with Firuzabad or Quintara negotiating with Aurelia. The details are not clear, but it resulted in a hostage release for Samuel Namara, Durke Bataglani, and Meggie Tazbah.\n\nSamuel Namara was previously a prisoner at Alhamia prison.
