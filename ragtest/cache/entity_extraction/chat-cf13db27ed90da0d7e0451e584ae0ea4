He was one of the first Americans building steam engines and an advocate of high pressure steam (vs. low pressure steam). A pioneer in the fields of automation, materials handling and steam power, Evans was one of the most prolific and influential inventors in the early years of the United States. He left behind a long series of accomplishments, most notably designing and building the first fully automated industrial process, the first high-pressure steam engine, and the first (albeit crude) amphibious vehicle and American automobile.\"\thttp://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_(state)\tOliver Evans\thttps://dbpedia.org/page/Oliver_Evans\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Evans?oldid=1124148098&ns=0\n\"Cadenabbia (Cadenabbia di Griante) is a small community in Lombardy, Italy, in the province of Como, on the west shore of Lake Como.
