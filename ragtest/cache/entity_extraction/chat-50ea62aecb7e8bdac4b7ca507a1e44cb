Identify all historical entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n   - entity_name: Name of the historical figure or organization, capitalized\n   - entity_type: One of the following types: [PERSON, ORGANIZATION, GEO, EVENT]\n   - entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's historical significance, including notable attributes and activities.\n   \n   **Include only entities relevant to historical figures or contexts.** For example, if an entity does not appear to have historical significance, skip it.\n\n   Format each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>).\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *historically related* to each other.\n   For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n   - source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n   - target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n   - relationship_description: explanation as to why the source entity and the target entity are historically connected\n   - relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating the significance of the relationship in historical terms, with stronger values for direct or impactful relationships.\n   \n   Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>).\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.
