{"result": " In Tiruzia, there were two hostages who were held captive - Durke Bataglani, an Aurelian journalist, and Meggie Tazbah, a Bratinas national and environmentalist. Firuzabad, a region in Tiruzia, was the location where these hostages were being kept.\n\nQuintara, a mediator, brokered the hostage exchange between Firuzabad and Aurelia. Samuel Namara, who was previously imprisoned at Alhamia prison, was one of the hostages released in this exchange. Along with Samuel Namara, Durke Bataglani and Meggie Tazbah were also exchanged in the same release. All three hostages had been held captive by Firuzabad.\n\nIn summary, Quintara played a crucial role in negotiating the release of the hostages who were being held in Firuzabad, Tiruzia. The released hostages included Durke Bataglani, Meggie Tazbah, and Samuel Namara.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1.
