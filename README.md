## AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generation from ECM Systems

### Project Overview
This project leverages AI to transform unstructured data from Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems into an interactive knowledge graph. By integrating GraphRAG for indexing and querying with Neo4j for graph visualization, the solution enables users to uncover insights, relationships, and patterns within their data efficiently.

The system features:

- Streamlit UI for file upload, graph visualization, chatbot querying, and dashboard.
- GraphRAG for processing text data and extracting meaningful relationships.
- Neo4j for creating and visualizing knowledge graphs that highlight entities and their relationships.

This tool is designed for business professionals, researchers, and analysts who need a simple, intuitive way to explore complex relationships in their data.

The repository contains notebooks, scripts, data files, and additional resources. For usage guidelines and a more in-depth theoretical overview, please refer to the wiki page.
