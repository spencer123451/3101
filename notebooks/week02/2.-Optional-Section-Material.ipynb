    "#### Step-by-Step Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1: Initialize the Git Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   cd path/to/your/project\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Initialize a new Git repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   git init\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 2: Create the Folder Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create the main project directory structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   mkdir -p project_name/{data/{raw,processed},notebooks,src,api,tests}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   NOTE: In some operating systems, this might not work so you will have to split this into different parts\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   mkdir -p project_name/data\n",
    "   mkdir -p project_name/{raw,processed}\n",
    "   mkdir -p project_name/notebooks\n",
    "   mkdir -p project_name/src\n",
    "   mkdir -p project_name/api\n",
    "   mkdir -p project_name/tests\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create the required files:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   touch project_name/{Dockerfile,docker-compose.yml,requirements.txt,setup.py,README.md,.gitignore}\n",
    "   touch project_name/src/{__init__.py,data_preprocessing.py,feature_engineering.py,model_training.py,model_evaluation.py,utils.py}\n",
    "   touch project_name/api/{__init__.py,app.py,routes.py,models.py,config.py}\n",

    "   touch project_name/notebooks/example_notebook.ipynb\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create placeholder files for static and template content:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   mkdir -p project_name/api/static\n",
    "   touch project_name/api/static/main.css\n",
    "   mkdir -p project_name/api/templates\n",
    "   touch project_name/api/templates/base.html\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 3: Add and Commit the Initial Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add all files to the Git staging area:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   git add .\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Commit the initial project structure:\n",

    "   ```sh\n",
    "   git commit -m \"Initial project structure with directories and files\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 4: Push to a Remote Repository (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new repository on GitHub (or another Git hosting service).\n",
    "2. Link the local repository to the remote repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/project_name.git\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Push the initial commit to the remote repository:\n",

    "Sphinx is a powerful documentation generator widely used for Python projects. It supports reStructuredText as its markup language and can output documentation in various formats, including HTML, LaTeX (for printable PDF versions), and ePub. This tutorial will guide you through the installation, setup, and usage of Sphinx for generating project documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Sphinx**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can install Sphinx using pip. Open your terminal and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   pip install sphinx\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Sphinx extensions** (optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "   Depending on your needs, you might want to install additional extensions. For example, `sphinx-rtd-theme` is a popular theme used for Sphinx documentation hosted on Read the Docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   pip install sphinx-rtd-theme\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Initializing Sphinx in Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigate to your project directory**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   cd path/to/your/project\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a `docs` directory**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   mkdir docs\n",
    "   cd docs\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialize Sphinx**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Run the following command and follow the prompts to set up your Sphinx project:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   sphinx-quickstart\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You'll be asked several questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Root path for the documentation**: (default is fine)\n",
    "   - **Separate source and build directories**: (choose yes for a clean structure)\n",
    "   - **Project name**: Enter your project's name.\n",
    "   - **Author name**: Enter your name or your organization's name.\n",
    "   - **Project release/version**: Enter the version of your project.\n",
    "   - **Choose a theme**: (default is fine; you can change it later)\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will create a basic directory structure and configuration files for Sphinx.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Configuring Sphinx\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Edit `conf.py`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Open the `docs/source/conf.py` file. This is the main configuration file for Sphinx. You can customize various settings here, such as the project information, extensions, and themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Add extensions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     extensions = [\n",
    "         'sphinx.ext.autodoc',\n",
    "         'sphinx.ext.napoleon',\n",
    "         'sphinx.ext.viewcode',\n",
    "     ]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "     These extensions enable automatic documentation generation from docstrings, support for NumPy and Google style docstrings, and inclusion of source code links in the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Set the theme**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "     This sets the theme to Read the Docs. Make sure you've installed `sphinx-rtd-theme`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create index file**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Open the `docs/source/index.rst` file. This is the root document of your documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```rst\n",
    "   Welcome to Your Project's documentation!\n",
    "   =======================================\n",
    "\n",
    "   .. toctree::\n",
    "      :maxdepth: 2\n",
    "      :caption: Contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can add additional documents here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Generating Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document your code with docstrings**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Ensure your Python code is properly documented with docstrings. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def add(a, b):\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       Add two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Parameters:\n",
    "       a (int): The first number.\n",
    "       b (int): The second number.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Returns:\n",
    "       int: The sum of the two numbers.\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       return a + b\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate reStructuredText files from your code**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Sphinx can automatically generate `.rst` files from your code using the `sphinx-apidoc` command. Run this command from the `docs` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   sphinx-apidoc -o source/ ../your_package\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Replace `your_package` with the path to your Python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Build the documentation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Run the following command from the `docs` directory to build your documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   make html\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will generate HTML documentation in the `_build/html` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Viewing the Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open the generated HTML documentation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Open `_build/html/index.html` in your web browser to view your documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customizing the theme**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  You can customize the theme by editing the `conf.py` file and adding additional settings specific to the theme you are using. For example, to customize the Read the Docs theme:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  html_theme_options = {\n",
    "      'collapse_navigation': False,\n",
    "      'sticky_navigation': True,\n",
    "      'navigation_depth': 4,\n",
    "      'includehidden': True,\n",
    "      'titles_only': False\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adding more documentation pages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  You can add more `.rst` files in the `docs/source` directory and include them in the `index.rst` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using Sphinx with Read the Docs**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  If you want to host your documentation on Read the Docs, you can follow their [official guide](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n"
